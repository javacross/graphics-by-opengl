# graphics-by-opengl-android
Android platform abstraction for graphics-by-opengl.
Uses 'graphics-by-opengl' and the Android GLSurfaceView.Renderer interface, future versions may support custom SurfaceView but at the moment there is no need to have control over EGL creation.
Use eclipse project files or pom file to import the project.
